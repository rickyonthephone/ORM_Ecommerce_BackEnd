# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Your Task
Ecommerce is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. 

Configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the readme of your project.
